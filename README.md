# bongocat-gen
A quick and dirty bongocat generator

Place your hit pattern in the hitmap.txt file:

First argument is the frame number when the cat taps the bongo.

Second argument specifies which paw will tap.

  * r is right paw pat
  * l is left paw pat
  * x is a fast right pat
  * y is a fast left pat
  * b is a pat from both paws

Once your hitmap.txt is set, run generate.sh to assemble your video and soundtrack.
